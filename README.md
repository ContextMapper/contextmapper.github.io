This is the repository of Context Mapper's website [https://contextmapper.org/](https://contextmapper.org/).

## Start Editing
The easiest way to get started with editing our website (including previewing) is starting the Gitpod IDE:

<a href="https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/" style="padding: 10px;">
    <img src="https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg" width="150" alt="Push" align="center">
</a>

Once the IDE is started and the init task finished, you can preview the page by running the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Gitpod allows you to make the open port public so that you are able to preview the page in your browser.

## Contribution
If you think something is missing on our documentation website and you still have unanswered questions, we are happy if you create an issue [here](https://github.com/ContextMapper/contextmapper.github.io/issues) allowing us to improve the docs. PRs are always welcome as well!
