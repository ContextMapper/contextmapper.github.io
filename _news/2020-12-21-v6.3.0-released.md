Today we released version 6.3.0 of Context Mapper ðŸ¥³ 

This release improves the [BPMN Sketch Miner Generator](/docs/bpmn-sketch-miner/) introduced in [v6.2.0](/news/2020/12/17/v6.2.0-released/). We aligned the visualization of CML events to the BPMN notation and improved the handling of potential loops in your event/command flows.

## Summary of Changes

## Sketch Miner Generator Improvements

We improved the visualization of our command/event flows powered by [BPMN Sketch Miner](https://www.bpmn-sketch-miner.ai/). The CML events are now properly mapped to Sketch Miner events, and the visualization is therefore aligned with to the BPMN syntax:

We also fixed a problem in the generator implementation that led to exceptions when having loops inside event flows. Loops are now properly handled and no longer lead to such errors.

Thats already it for this new release of Context Mapper. As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
