Today we released version 6.5.0 of Context Mapper ðŸ¥³ 

With this minor release we improved the [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) generator so that it generates class diagrams on aggregate level as well.

### PlantUML Class Diagrams
 * So far we only generated class diagrams for a complete Bounded Context.
 * This approach can lead to big diagrams that are often not usable in architecture documentations (for example in PDF format).
 * In some cases it is desired to generate a class diagram per Aggregate.
 * With this release, the [PlantUML generator](/docs/plant-uml/) generates not only a class diagram for each Bounded Context, but for each Aggregate inside the Bounded Contexts as well.

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
