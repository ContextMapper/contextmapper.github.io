Today we released version 6.7.0; with this release you can finally run Context Mapper with Java 17 ü•≥ 

In addition, this minor release comes with some little language (CML) changes for [bounded context canvas](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas) 
support and PlantUML generator additions. 

### Context Mapper and Java 17
Many of you have reported it in the past months. Context Mapper only worked with Java 8 and 11. With this release we finally have a version that is built with target 11
and runs on 17 as well.

Therefore, we officially support (and tested) Java 11 and 17 for this release.

### Bounded Context Canvas
We added the two new attributes `businessModel` and `evolution` to the Bounded Context in CML in order to support modeling according to the 
[bounded context canvas](https://github.com/ddd-crew/bounded-context-canvas). This new features is documented [here](/docs/bounded-context/#support-for-bounded-context-canvases).

Many thanks to [@boxleytw](https://github.com/boxleytw) for the contribution! üôè

### PlantUML Generator Additions
The CML language now allows users to specify additional information about relations between domain objects (entities, value objects, etc.), such as multiplicity and custom labels,
that are then used in the [PlantUML generator](/docs/plant-uml/).

See the examples in this CML model:

```cml
BoundedContext CustomerManagementContext {
  Aggregate Customers {
    Entity Customer {
      aggregateRoot
			
      - @Address address nullable
      - List<@City> cities
      - List<@City> towns size="min=1,max=4"
      - List<@Order> orders
      - @Thing thing -- "things"

      * void anotherMethod(@Name name);
      * @ReturnTypeEntity createReturnTypeEntity();

      -- "lives at" @Address
      -- "uses >" @Name
      -- "creates >" @ReturnTypeEntity
    }
		
    Entity Address {
      - @City city
      String name
    }

    ValueObject City {
      String name
    }

    ValueObject Name {
      String first
      String last
    }

    Entity ReturnTypeEntity {
      int i
    }

    Entity ManyToManyFirst {
      - List<@ManyToManySecond> seconds -- "interact"
    }

    Entity ManyToManySecond {
      - List<@ManyToManyFirst> firsts	-- "interact"
    }

    Entity Thing {
      int i
    }
  }

  Aggregate Orders {
    Entity Order {
      String something
    }
  }
}
```

This CML produces the following PlantUML output:
