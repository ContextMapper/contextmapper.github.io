Today we released version 6.10.0 of Context Mapper in order to fix the following two issues:

 * The Context Mapper Visual Studio Code extension still exposed the vulnerable library log4j 1.2.17.
   * This issue was caused by our [Service Cutter library/integration](https://contextmapper.org/docs/service-cutter-context-map-suggestions/).
   * **Note** that we deactivated Service Cutter features in Context Mapper (Eclipse, VS Code, CLI) for the moment in order to remove this vulnerability.
 * Context Mapper 6.10.0 is now compatible with Eclipse 2023-09.
   * This was not the case for v6.9.0 ([#349](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/349)).

**Update:**
The context menu in the VS Code extension still shows the Service Cutter features, but they are not working!

We'll remove them with the next release. Sorry for the inconvenience.

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
