Today we released version 6.10.0 of Context Mapper in order to fix the following two issues:

 * The Context Mapper Visual Studio Code extension still exposed the vulnerable library log4j 1.2.17.
   * This issue was caused by our [Service Cutter library/integration](https://contextmapper.org/docs/service-cutter-context-map-suggestions/).
   * **Note** that we deactivated Service Cutter features in Context Mapper for the moment in order to remove this vulnerability.
 * Context Mapper 6.10.0 is now compatible with Eclipse 2023-09.
   * This was not the case for v6.9.0 ([#349](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/349)).

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
