Today we released version 6.4.0 of Context Mapper ðŸ¥³ 

This release contains some bug fixes, improvements in the CML grammar, and it changes how the [OOAD transformation step 3](/docs/rapid-ooad/) handles object identifiers.

## Bug Fixes

 * State transitions can have more than two states on the left side now.
 * The [markdown glossary template](/docs/generic-freemarker-generator/#example-templates) has been improved and some bugs were fixed.

## CML Grammar Improvements
 * Object attributes on the tactic DDD level can be marked with the keyword `unique` to indicate that its values must be unique.
 * Use Case / User Story grammar:
   * In addition to `a` and `an`, `the` can now be used as an entity article.

## OOAD Step 3 Change
 * The OOAD step 3 transformation no longer generates Value Objects for the Entity identifiers, but simply generate a String attribute.
   * The String attribute can still be transformed into a Value Object with the corresponding quick fix.
   * This change improves the output of the MDSL generator (VO's not necessarily desired in rapid prototyping process).

Thats already it for this new release of Context Mapper. As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
