Today we released version 6.9.0 of Context Mapper ðŸ¥³ With this release we implemented the following features and bug fixes:

 * The Use Case diagram has been enhanced with meta data about the cases or stories ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/335)).
 * The PlantUML generator creates a new Sequence diagram that illustrates the interactions of a Use Case ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/336)).
 * A small improvement in the following error message has been implemented: [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/340)
 * TLA Sample Application: We created a new sample application that illustrates how to use our ArchUnit extension and how our generated diagrams can be used in your documentation.

**Hint**: Also note that we [changed our Eclipse Update Site URLs](https://contextmapper.org/news/2023/06/13/eclipse-update-site-url-changed/)! If you still have the old URL within your Eclipse installation, you have to re-install Context Mapper.

**Warning**: Please also note that the current Context Mapper release does unfortunately not work with Eclipse 2023-03. Please use 2022-12 for now; we try to fix this issue as soon as possible.
