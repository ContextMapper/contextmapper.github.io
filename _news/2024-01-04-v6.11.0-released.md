Today we released version 6.11.0 of Context Mapper üéÜ 

It contains a new feature (Coordinations) contributed by [Miguel Levezinho](https://github.com/mLeveIST) as well as some little fixes:

 * **Coordination between Application Services**: In case you want to model processes/workflows that span multiple Bounded Contexts without the use of event/command syntax, you can now also do so by defining a coordination between application services.
   * See some details below und the complete documentation [here](/docs/application-and-process-layer/#coordination-between-application-services).
   * Many thanks to [Miguel Levezinho](https://github.com/mLeveIST) for the contribution! üôè
 * With [v6.10.0](https://contextmapper.org/news/2023/11/24/v6.10.0-released/) we had to **remove the Service Cutter features in Context Mapper** but forgot to remove the actions in the context menu of the VS Code extension. This is fixed now.
 * Bugfix: **Subdomains** which are implemented by a Bounded Context but **imported from another CML file** are now respected in the PlantUML generator (fix for [#321](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/321)).


### Coordination between Application Services
In case you want to model processes/workflows that span multiple Bounded Contexts without the use of event/command syntax, you can also do so by defining a coordination between application services. This language feature is based on the concept of Coordination from the ["Software Architecture: The Hard Parts"](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Architecture-Trade-Off-Distributed-Architectures/dp/1492086894) book by Neal Ford and others. They define Coordination as a property of workflows, which can either be orchestrated (the workflow steps are coordinated by a central component) or choreographed (each step of the workflow shares coordination logic).

To model these workflows in Context Mapper, you use the _coordination_ construct inside the _application_ layer of a Bounded Context. The following example illustrates this using an adaptation of the same claims processing concept from before:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">ContextMap</span> {
  <span class="k">contains</span> ClaimsManagement
  <span class="k">contains</span> InsuranceManagement
  <span class="k">contains</span> PaymentManagement

  ClaimsManagement &lt;-&gt; InsuranceManagement
  ClaimsManagement &lt;-&gt; PaymentManagement
}

<span class="k">BoundedContext</span> ClaimsManagement {
  <span class="k">Application</span> {
    <span class="k">Coordination</span> SubmitValidClaimCoordination {
      ClaimsManagement::ClaimsApplicationService::submitClaim;
      InsuranceManagement::InsuranceApplicationService::checkInsurance;
      ClaimsManagement::ClaimsApplicationService::acceptClaim;
      PaymentManagement::PaymentApplicationService::performPayment;
    }

    <span class="k">Service</span> ClaimsApplicationService {
      <span class="k">void</span> submitClaim(@Claim claim);
      <span class="k">void</span> acceptClaim(@Claim claim);
    }
  }
}

<span class="k">BoundedContext</span> InsuranceManagement {
  <span class="k">Application</span> {
    <span class="k">Service</span> InsuranceApplicationService {
      <span class="k">void</span> checkInsurance(@Claim claim);
    }
  }
}

<span class="k">BoundedContext</span> PaymentManagement {
  <span class="k">Application</span> {
    <span class="k">Service</span> PaymentApplicationService {
      <span class="k">void</span> performPayment(@Claim claim);
    }
  }
}

</pre></div>

Once you have modelled your coordinations, Context Mapper can visualize them with [BPMN Sketch Miner](https://www.bpmn-sketch-miner.ai/):
