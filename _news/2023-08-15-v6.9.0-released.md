Today we released version 6.9.0 of Context Mapper ðŸ¥³ With this release we implemented the following features and bug fixes:

 * The Use Case diagram has been enhanced with metadata about the cases or stories ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/335)).
 * The PlantUML generator creates a new Sequence diagram that illustrates the interactions of a Use Case ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/336)).
 * A small improvement in the following error message has been implemented: [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/340)
 * TLA Sample Application: We created a new sample application that illustrates how to use our ArchUnit extension and how our generated diagrams can be used in your documentation.

<strong>Hint:</strong> Also note that we <a target="_blank" href="/news/2023/06/13/eclipse-update-site-url-changed/">changed our Eclipse Update Site URLs</a>!
If you still have the old URL within your Eclipse installation, you have to re-install Context Mapper.

<strong>Warning:</strong> Please also note that the current Context Mapper release seems not to work with Eclipse 2023-03. We recommend using the latest <strong>release 2023-06 
of Eclipse</strong> instead.
</div>

**Warning**: Please also note that the current Context Mapper release does unfortunately not work with Eclipse 2023-03. Please use 2022-12 for now; we try to fix this issue as soon as possible.

### Use Case Diagram Enhancement
The [CML attributes _scope_, _level_ and _benefit_](/docs/user-requirements/#cockburn-styles) are now also used in the [PlantUML Use Case Diagram Generator](/docs/plant-uml/#uml-use-case-diagrams).
As the following example illustrated, we add these metadata of the use cases as notes to the PlantUML diagrams:

### New Sequence Diagram Generator for Use Case Interactions
In order to graphically illustrate the [interactions of a Use Case](/docs/user-requirements/#use-case), we now generate a PlantUML Sequence diagram. 
The following example illustrates the interactions of our [claims example (Get_paid_for_car_accident)](/docs/user-requirements/#cockburn-styles):

<div class="alert alert-custom">
<strong>Note:</strong> As the note on the diagram already says, the generated diagram illustrates interactions in an early analysis state. We are aware that the generated
interactions might not be triggered/connected by/with the correct actor(s). This is a known limitation.
</div>

### TLA Sample Application
Finally, we started implementing a [sample application](https://github.com/ContextMapper/ddd-cm-tla-sample-application) with the goal to illustrate:

 * How to validate a Domain-driven Design (DDD) model implementation (tactic, code) against a Context Mapper model using our [ArchUnit extension](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-archunit-extension).
 * How to use generated diagrams of Context Mapper inside your documentation (in this case the [arc42 document](https://contextmapper.org/ddd-cm-tla-sample-application/architecture) that automatically is generated in the CI/CD pipeline).
 * How to implement an application using tactic DDD patterns and [Onion Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/2017/09/21/onion-architecture/) (just an example; we are not claiming that this is "the way" at all).

The sample application shows how you can ensure that your CML domain models and the code do not deviate - as we have described it in our [JavaSPEKTRUM article](/media/SD-00-Java-06-SP-Kapferer-Zimmermann.pdf) and the 
[blogpost of Stefan Kapferer (case study)](https://blog.mimacom.com/ddd-and-context-mapper-experience/).

You can find the sample application [here](https://github.com/ContextMapper/ddd-cm-tla-sample-application).
