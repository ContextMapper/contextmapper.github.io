Today we released Context Mapper 5.14.0 ðŸ¥³ This is a minor release which improves the structured service decomposition features based on [Service Cutter](https://github.com/ServiceCutter/ServiceCutter/).

You can now generate new service cut's without losing the data types of all your Entity attributes. We further improved the [Service Cutter generators](/docs/service-cutter/): most of the user representations in the SCL file are now derived from your CML model automatically.

In addition, all Service Cutter features in Context Mapper are now available in our [VS Code extension](/docs/vs-code/) ðŸ™Œ

Checkout our new [Systematic Service Decomposition with Context Mapper and Service Cutter](/docs/systematic-service-decomposition/) tutorial to learn how you can generate new service decompositions (or service cut's) in Context Mapper!

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
