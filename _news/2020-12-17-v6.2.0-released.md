Today we released version 6.2.0 of Context Mapper ðŸ¥³ 

With this new Context Mapper version we introduce new CML language features to model application layers with application services and commands, event/command flows (potentially as a result of an [Event Storming](/docs/event-storming/)), and the lifecycle of Aggregates. We further added a [generator](/docs/bpmn-sketch-miner/) that visualizes the event flows powered by [BPMN Sketch Miner](https://www.bpmn-sketch-miner.ai/) and enhanced the [PlantUML generator](/docs/plant-uml/#uml-state-diagram) with state diagrams. The [MDSL generator](/docs/mdsl/) as well as the [PlantUML class diagram generator](/docs/plant-uml/#uml-class-diagram) have been enhanced to support the new [application layer and flow features](/docs/application-and-process-layer/). Last but not least, this release contains a "proof of concept" for automated model transformations that support _[Story Splitting](/docs/story-splitting/)_.

## Aggregate Lifecycle and State Transitions
The CML syntax allows to model the states of Aggregates now. The states are defined as an enum which is is marked as follows:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Aggregate</span> Contract {
  <span class="k">Entity</span> Contract {
    <span class="k">aggregateRoot</span>

    - <span class="k">State</span> aggregateState
    - <span class="k">ContractId</span> identifier
    - <span class="k">Customer</span> client
    - <span class="k">List</span>&lt;Product&gt; products
  }

  <span class="k">enum</span> State {
    <span class="k">aggregateLifecycle</span>
    CREATED, POLICE_CREATED, RECALLED
  }
}
</pre></div>

Users can then model whether an operation is a _read-only_ or a _write_ operation; and in case it is a write operation, the state transition that the operation performs (supported on operations in services or domain objects such as entities):

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Service</span> ContractService {
    @ContractId createContract(@Contract contrace) : <span class="k">write</span> [ -&gt; CREATED];
    @Contract getContract(@ContractId contractId) : <span class="k">read</span>-<span class="k">only</span>;
    <span class="k">boolean</span> createPolicy(@ContractId contractId) : <span class="k">write</span> [ CREATED -&gt; POLICE_CREATED ];
    <span class="k">boolean</span> recall(@ContractId contractId) : <span class="k">write</span> [ CREATED, POLICE_CREATED -&gt; RECALLED ];
  }
</pre></div>

More details about the new syntax for Aggregate lifecycles and state transitions can be found [here](/docs/aggregate/#aggregate-lifecycle-and-state-transitions) on the [Aggregate page of the language reference](/docs/aggregate/#aggregate-lifecycle-and-state-transitions).

## Application Layer and Event Flows
DDD distinguishes between domain services and application services. Inside a Bounded Context you can now model an application layer in CML. Such an application layer can contain application services and commands that are initiated by users or external systems:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">BoundedContext</span> ClaimsManagement {
  <span class="k">Application</span> {
    <span class="k">Service</span> ClaimsApplicationService {
      <span class="k">void</span> submitClaim(@Claim claim);
      <span class="k">void</span> checkInsurance(@Claim claim);
    }

    <span class="k">Command</span> AcceptClaim {
      - <span class="k">Claim</span> claim
    }
    <span class="k">Command</span> RejectClaim {
      - <span class="k">Claim</span> claim
    }
  }
  
  <span class="k">Aggregate</span> Claims {
    <span class="k">Entity</span> Claim {
      <span class="k">aggregateRoot</span>
      <span class="k">long</span> claimId
      CustomerId <span class="k">customer</span>
      <span class="k">String</span> description
      <span class="k">Blob</span> requestDocument
      <span class="k">boolean</span> isComplete
      <span class="k">boolean</span> isAssessed
      - <span class="k">ClaimState</span> claimState
    }
    <span class="k">enum</span> ClaimState {
      <span class="k">aggregateLifecycle</span>
      OPEN, REJECTED, ACCEPTED
    }
  }
}
</pre></div>

In addition to that, the application layer can contain event/command flows. They can be used to model processes and bring events and commands into a timeline (for example as a result of an [Event Storming](/docs/event-storming/)).

An example:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">Application</span> {

  <span class="c">/* we removed commands and events here to keep the sample shorter */</span>

  <span class="k">Flow</span> ClaimsFlow {
    <span class="k">command</span> SubmitClaim <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> ClaimSubmitted
    <span class="k">event</span> ClaimSubmitted <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">command</span> CheckClaimDocumentation
    <span class="k">command</span> CheckClaimDocumentation <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> ClaimRegistered
    <span class="k">event</span> ClaimRegistered <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">command</span> CheckInsurance
    <span class="k">command</span> CheckInsurance <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> AssessmentPerformed

    <span class="k">event</span> AssessmentPerformed <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">command</span> AcceptClaim <span class="k">X</span> RejectClaim 
    <span class="k">command</span> AcceptClaim <span class="k">delegates</span> <span class="k">to</span> Claims [OPEN -&gt; ACCEPTED] <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> ClaimAccepted
    <span class="k">command</span> RejectClaim <span class="k">delegates</span> <span class="k">to</span> Claims [OPEN -&gt; REJECTED] <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> ClaimRejected

    <span class="k">event</span> ClaimAccepted <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">command</span> SchedulePayment
    <span class="k">command</span> SchedulePayment <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> PaymentPerformed
    <span class="k">event</span> PaymentPerformed <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">command</span> NofifyCustomer
    <span class="k">event</span> ClaimRejected <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">command</span> NofifyCustomer
    <span class="k">command</span> NofifyCustomer <span class="k">delegates</span> <span class="k">to</span> Claims [ACCEPTED, REJECTED -&gt; CUSTOMER_NOTIFIED] <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> CustomerNotified
  }
}
</pre></div>

In this case the modeled flow is based on the output of our [Event Storming tutorial](/docs/event-storming/):

## BPMN Sketch Miner Generator
The [BPMN Sketch Miner generator](/docs/bpmn-sketch-miner/) visualizes the CML event/command flows introduced above powered by the [BPMN Sketch Miner](https://www.bpmn-sketch-miner.ai/) tool.

We modeled the following CML flow, as another example:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c">/**</span>
<span class="c"> * A flow inspired by the Lakeside Mutual project (https://github.com/Microservice-API-Patterns/LakesideMutual).</span>
<span class="c"> * Find the original process visualization here:</span>
<span class="c"> * https://github.com/Microservice-API-Patterns/LakesideMutual/blob/master/policy-management-backend/src/main/java/com/lakesidemutual/policymanagement/domain/insurancequoterequest/RequestStatus.java</span>
<span class="c"> **/</span>
<span class="k">BoundedContext</span> InsuranceQuotes {
  <span class="k">Application</span> {
    <span class="k">Flow</span> QuoteRequestFlow {
      <span class="k">operation</span> submitRequest <span class="k">delegates</span> <span class="k">to</span> QuoteRequest[-<span class="k">&gt;</span> SUBMITTED] <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> RequestSubmitted
      <span class="k">event</span> RequestSubmitted + RequestSubmitted <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">operation</span> checkRequest
      <span class="k">operation</span> checkRequest <span class="k">delegates</span> <span class="k">to</span> QuoteRequest[SUBMITTED -&gt; RECEIVED <span class="k">X</span> REJECTED] <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> QuoteReceived <span class="k">X</span> RequestRejected
      <span class="k">event</span> QuoteReceived <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">operation</span> receiveAndCheckQuote
      <span class="k">operation</span> receiveAndCheckQuote <span class="k">delegates</span> <span class="k">to</span> QuoteRequest[RECEIVED -&gt; REJECTED <span class="k">X</span> ACCEPTED <span class="k">X</span> EXPIRED] <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> QuoteRejected <span class="k">X</span> QuoteAccepted <span class="k">X</span> QuoteExpired
      <span class="k">event</span> QuoteAccepted <span class="k">triggers</span> <span class="k">operation</span> accept
      <span class="k">operation</span> accept <span class="k">delegates</span> <span class="k">to</span> QuoteRequest[ACCEPTED -&gt; POLICY_CREATED <span class="k">X</span> EXPIRED] <span class="k">emits</span> <span class="k">event</span> PolicyCreated <span class="k">X</span> QuoteExpired
    }
  }
  <span class="k">Aggregate</span> QuoteRequest {
    <span class="k">Entity</span> Request {
      <span class="k">aggregateRoot</span>
    }
    <span class="k">DomainEvent</span> RequestSubmitted
    <span class="k">DomainEvent</span> QuoteReceived
    <span class="k">DomainEvent</span> RequestRejected
    <span class="k">DomainEvent</span> QuoteRejected
    <span class="k">DomainEvent</span> QuoteAccepted
    <span class="k">DomainEvent</span> QuoteExpired
    <span class="k">DomainEvent</span> PolicyCreated
    <span class="k">Service</span> QuoteRequestService {
      <span class="k">void</span> submitRequest(@Request request);
      <span class="k">void</span> checkRequest(@Request request);
      <span class="k">void</span> receiveAndCheckQuote(@Request request);
      <span class="k">void</span> reject(@Request request);
      <span class="k">void</span> accept(@Request request);
    }
    <span class="k">enum</span> RequestState {
      <span class="k">aggregateLifecycle</span>
       SUBMITTED, RECEIVED, REJECTED, ACCEPTED, EXPIRED, POLICY_CREATED
    }
  }
}
</pre></div>

By using this generator users can visualize this flow quickly and get the following output: <br />(powered by [BPMN Sketch Miner](https://www.bpmn-sketch-miner.ai/))

<a href="/img/bpmn-sketch-miner-example-for-news.png" target="_blank">![BPMN Sketch Miner Output Example](/img/bpmn-sketch-miner-example-for-news.png)</a>

More details on this generator and how to use it can be found on the [BPMN Sketch Miner Generator](/docs/bpmn-sketch-miner/) page.

## PlantUML Generator Adjustments
The [PlantUML class diagram generator](/docs/plant-uml/#uml-class-diagram) has been enhanced so that services and commands of the application layer are respected as well. An example output:

<a href="/img/application-layer-example-plantuml-class-diagram.png" target="_blank">![PlantUML: Enhanced class diagram generator](/img/application-layer-example-plantuml-class-diagram.png)</a>

In addition to that, the generator now produces state diagrams that visualize the Aggregate lifecycles introduced above: (in case you modeled the corresponding states and state transitions)

<a href="/img/QuoteRequestFlow_BC_InsuranceQuotes_QuoteRequestFlow_StateDiagram.png" target="_blank">![PlantUML: Enhanced class diagram generator](/img/QuoteRequestFlow_BC_InsuranceQuotes_QuoteRequestFlow_StateDiagram.png)</a>

## MDSL Generator Adjustments
The MDSL generator has been enhanced as follows:

 * A new endpoint is generated for the application layer.
   * The endpoint contains the operations of the application services and/or commands.
 * Events and/or commands that are used as parameters or return types of operations in CML are now properly mapped to corresponding data types in MDSL.

## Story Splitting (PoC)
With our story splitting proof-of-concept (PoC) we offer a first model transformation that can split a CML user story. We only implemented one exemplary transformation for now, but other [splitting patterns](https://agileforall.com/patterns-for-splitting-user-stories/) could be supported in the future. This first PoC provides a transformation that can "split a story by its verb" quickly.

For example, a user may write the following user story in CML:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">UserStory</span> Account_Admin_Story {
    <span class="k">As</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Admin&quot;</span> <span class="k">I</span> <span class="k">want</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="s">&quot;manage&quot;</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Account&quot;</span> <span class="k">so</span> <span class="k">that</span> <span class="s">&quot;can enable users to work with the system.&quot;</span>
}
</pre></div>

By providing verbs to split the story, for example _create_, _edit_, and _cancel_, you can split this story very quickly: (one click and typing the verbs)

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">UserStory</span> Account_Admin_Story <span class="k">split</span> <span class="k">by</span> Account_Admin_Story_Split {
	<span class="k">As</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Admin&quot;</span> <span class="k">I</span> <span class="k">want</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="s">&quot;manage&quot;</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Account&quot;</span> <span class="k">so</span> <span class="k">that</span> <span class="s">&quot;can enable users to work with the system.&quot;</span>
}

<span class="k">UserStory</span> Account_Admin_Story_Split {
	<span class="k">As</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Admin&quot;</span>
	<span class="k">I</span> <span class="k">want</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="s">&quot;cancel&quot;</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Account&quot;</span>
	<span class="k">I</span> <span class="k">want</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="s">&quot;edit&quot;</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Account&quot;</span>
	<span class="k">I</span> <span class="k">want</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="k">create</span> <span class="k">an</span> <span class="s">&quot;Account&quot;</span>
	<span class="k">so</span> <span class="k">that</span> <span class="s">&quot;can enable users to work with the system.&quot;</span>
}
</pre></div>

You can find more details on how you can use this transformation on our [documentation page](/docs/story-splitting/).

## Semantic Validator Changes
 * [Domain](/docs/subdomain/) names must be unique now (duplicate domain names no longer compile in CML models).
 * A [subdomain](/docs/subdomain/) can no longer have the same name as its [domain](/docs/subdomain/).

## Summary
Thats it for this new release of Context Mapper. As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
