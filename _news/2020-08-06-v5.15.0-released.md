Today we released Context Mapper 5.15.0 ðŸ¥³ 

With this release we finally support [all Context Mapper features](/docs/ide/) in [VS Code](/docs/vs-code/) and [online](/docs/online-ide/).
You can now use all [OOAD](/docs/rapid-ooad/) transformations and [Architectural Refactorings (ARs)](/docs/architectural-refactorings/) there as well. Moreover, we included additional graph clustering algorithms ([Markov Clustering](https://www.micans.org/mcl/) and [Chinese Whispers](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1654758.1654774)) into our [systematic service decomposition](/docs/systematic-service-decomposition/) solution.

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
