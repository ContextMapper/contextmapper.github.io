**Do you design your domain models with the Context Mapper DSL (CML) and want to ensure that the `*.cml` file is kept _in-sync_ with the actual code? Then you may want to have a look at our new [ArchUnit extension](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-archunit-extension).**

We released a first version of our [ArchUnit extension](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-archunit-extension) that allows Context Mapper users to enforce that tactic DDD concepts implemented in the code, conform to the CML model. Read more about it in our short tutorial: [Validating the Implementation against the Model (with ArchUnit)](/docs/architecture-validation-with-archunit/).

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
