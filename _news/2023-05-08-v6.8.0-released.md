Today we released version 6.8.0 of Context Mapper ðŸ¥³ With this release we implemented the following features and bugfixes:

 * Target states in aggregate state transitions are used in PlantUML generator ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/316)).
 * Tactic DDD DSL bugfix: lists of enums are now possible ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/325))
 * Tactic DDD DSL enhancement: domain services can be specified alongside aggregates, instead of inside aggregates ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/326)).
 * PlantUML Use Case diagram generation  ([GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/issues/291)).


### Target States in PlantUML State Diagram Generator
As we have already documented [here](/docs/aggregate/#aggregate-lifecycle-and-state-transitions), you can use an asterisk (*) to mark _target states_ in aggregate state transitions:

<div class="highlight"><pre>
<span class="c">// target states can be marked as end states with a star:</span>
CHECK_IN_PROGRESS -&gt; ACCEPTED* <span class="k">X</span> REJECTED*
</pre></div>

If you use these asterisks, they are now used in the [PlantUML generator](/docs/plant-uml/#uml-state-diagram) to visualize the _end states_ correspondingly. An example:

### Tactic DDD: Lists of Enums
Sometimes it can be useful to have collections of enum values. This was not supported by the original [Sculptor DSL](http://sculptorgenerator.org/) as we integrated it. We adjusted the DSL now so that collections of enums are supported. The following example illustrates a use case:

### Tactic DDD: Domain Services outside Aggregates
The tactic DDD DSL so far expected domain services to be specified within aggregates. This does not match with our understanding of the tactic DDD patterns. A domain service does not have to belong to a specific aggregate and should therefore not be specified on that level. 

With this newest release, you can specify the services on the same level as aggregates:

![Domain Services on Aggregate Level](/img/domain-services-on-aggregate-level-example.png)

**Note:** The [MDSL generator](/docs/mdsl/) currently only uses operations of services inside aggregates that are exposed in your Context Map. So these services specified besides aggregates are currently ignored there.

### PlantUML Use Case Diagram Generation
It was possible to write use cases and user stories in CML already before this release. The documentation on how to write such user requirements can be found [here](/docs/user-requirements/).

Just one example:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">UseCase</span> Get_paid_for_car_accident { <span class="c">// title</span>
  <span class="k">actor</span> <span class="s">&quot;Claimant&quot;</span> <span class="c">// primary actor</span>
  <span class="k">scope</span> <span class="s">&quot;Insurance company&quot;</span> <span class="c">// scope</span>
  <span class="k">level</span> <span class="s">&quot;Summary&quot;</span> <span class="c">// level</span>
  <span class="k">benefit</span> <span class="s">&quot;A claimant submits a claim and and gets paid from the insurance company.&quot;</span> <span class="c">// story (brief summary)</span>
}
</pre></div>

With this release we added the _secondaryActors_ keyword in case you want to specify that your use case also involves secondary actors:

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">UseCase</span> UC1_Example {
  <span class="k">actor</span> = <span class="s">&quot;Insurance Employee&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">secondaryActors</span> = <span class="s">&quot;Insurance Administrator&quot;</span>, <span class="s">&quot;Sales Person&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">interactions</span> = <span class="k">create</span> <span class="k">a</span> <span class="s">&quot;Customer&quot;</span>, <span class="k">update</span> <span class="k">a</span> <span class="s">&quot;Customer&quot;</span>, <span class="s">&quot;offer&quot;</span> <span class="k">a</span> <span class="s">&quot;Contract&quot;</span>
  <span class="k">benefit</span> = <span class="s">&quot;I am able to manage the customers data and offer them insurance contracts.&quot;</span>
}
</pre></div>

If your CML model contains use cases and/or user stories, we now generate a Use Case diagram as part of the output of the [PlantUML generator](/docs/plant-uml/#uml-use-case-diagrams). An example:
