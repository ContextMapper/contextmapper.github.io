Dear Context Mapper users

**This is an important note for all of those who use Context Mapper in Eclipse!**

Since [bintray.com](https://bintray.com/) has stopped their service, we had to move our Eclipse update site. The old URL (~~https://dl.bintray.com/contextmapper/context-mapping-dsl/updates/~~) is no longer available.

To update and install Context Mapper in Eclipse, use the **new update site URL: [https://contextmapper.jfrog.io/artifactory/context-mapper-eclipse/updates/](https://contextmapper.jfrog.io/artifactory/context-mapper-eclipse/updates/)** <br>(or install it via [Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/context-mapper)).

Sorry for the inconvenience!

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
