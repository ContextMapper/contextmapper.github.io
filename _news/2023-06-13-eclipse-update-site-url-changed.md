title: "Eclipse Update Site URL Changed"

Dear Context Mapper users

**This is an important note for everybody using Context Mapper in Eclipse!**

We decided to move our Eclipse update sites. The old URL (~~https://contextmapper.jfrog.io/artifactory/context-mapper-eclipse/updates/~~) therefore is no longer available.

To update and install Context Mapper in Eclipse, use our **new update site URL: [https://contextmapper.org/eclipse-update-site/](https://contextmapper.org/eclipse-update-site/)** 
(or just install it via [Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/context-mapper)).

If you have Context Mapper already installed in your Eclipse, you have to re-install it in order to receive our future updates.

Sorry for the inconvenience!

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
