Version 6.6.0 of Context Mapper is available now.  

This minor release extends the [MDSL generator](https://contextmapper.org/docs/mdsl/) to convert [application layer flows](https://contextmapper.org/docs/application-and-process-layer/) in CML into API [orchestration flows](https://microservice-api-patterns.github.io/MDSL-Specification/flows) in [MDSL](https://microservice-api-patterns.github.io/MDSL-Specification/index). Note that only commands are supported; operations cannot be mapped. 

The previous two releases 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 fixed bugs, see the [Relase Notes](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/releases).

As always, if you have any issues or other feedback, please [let us know](/getting-involved/).
