Frequently asked questions:

### Where can I download the Eclipse Plugin?
Use the following Eclipse Update Site and install the plugin in Eclipse via *Help -> Install New Software...* (copy past the update site link)

Update Site: [https://dl.bintray.com/contextmapper/context-mapping-dsl/updates/](https://dl.bintray.com/contextmapper/context-mapping-dsl/updates/)

### How do I create a new context map?
Just create a file with the file extension **cml** (Context Mapping Language). Take a look at our example to get an idea how it looks like: [https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples)

### Which DDD Patterns are supported by CML?
Have a look at our [CML Reference - Introduction](/docs/language-reference/) page. There you will find all patterns supported by CML.

### Which combinations of Strategic DDD Patterns are allowed? 
Have a look at the page [Language Semantic Model](/docs/language-model/) which introduces the semantic model of our DSL and lists the implemented semantic checkers.

### Which transformations can I apply to my CML model?
Currently you can generate Service Cutter input to get suggestion for service cuts or new bounded context, and you can generate UML (plantUML) diagrams out of your CML. The following pages explain how you can do that:

 * [Generate Service Cutter Input Files](/docs/service-cutter/)
 * [Generate plantUML Diagrams](/docs/plant-uml/)

### I have other questions not listed here. How can I contribute?
If you have any questions not answered by our documentation page, we are happy if you create an issue in our documentation [repo](https://github.com/ContextMapper/contextmapper.github.io/issues). Of course, PR's are always welcome as well.

Your contribution is welcome!
