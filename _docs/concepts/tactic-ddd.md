title: Tactic DDD Patterns
permalink: /docs/tactic-ddd/
---

The tactic DDD part of the CML language, meaning all rules inside *modules* and *aggregates*, are based on the [Sculptor DSL](https://github.com/sculptor/sculptor). Thus, we reference to their [documentation](http://sculptorgenerator.org/documentation/advanced-tutorial#domain-driven-design) for details regarding the tactic DDD patterns.

However, the most important tactic DDD patterns we also use for our transformations (Service Cutter integration and plantUML generation) are the following:

 * **Module**
 * **Aggregate** (and *Aggregate Root*)
 * **Entity**
 * **Value Object**
 * **Domain Event**

The following patterns are supported as well, but currently not used in the transformations:

 * **Service**
 * **Repository**
