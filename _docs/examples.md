Please find our CML examples in the following Github repository: [https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples).

There you find an example of a fictitious insurance company and the DDD sample. All the graphical illustrations of our sample Context Maps are inspired by [Vernon][1] and [Brandolini][2].

## Architectural Refactoring (AR) Examples
The examples which you can find behind the link below provide smaller CML snippets of the insurance example to illustrate how
you can apply refactorings to your models.
