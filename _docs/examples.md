Please find the CML examples featured on this page in the following GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples).

In the examples repository, you can find the domain model and strategic DDD description of the services and application landscape in Lakeside Mutual, a fictitious insurance company, and the CML version of a classical DDD sample (cargo routing and tracking). 

The following graphical illustrations of our sample Context Maps are inspired by [Vernon][1] and [Brandolini][2].

## Architectural Refactoring (AR) Examples
The following folder contains a number of small CML snippets from the insurance example; they illustrate how you can apply refactorings to your models:
