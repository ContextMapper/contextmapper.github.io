We currently offer Context Mapper for Visual Studio Code and Eclipse:

 * [Context Mapper for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=contextmapper.context-mapper-vscode-extension) (Marketplace)
 * [Context Mapper for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/context-mapper) (Marketplace)

<div class="alert alert-custom"><strong>Note:</strong> We have only recently published the <strong>VS Code extension</strong> and it does <strong>not support all the features yet</strong>. In case you need all the features, you have to work with Eclipse for now. We work on the VS code extension and hope to <strong>support all the features soon</strong>!
