<div class="alert alert-danger">
<strong>Note:</strong> The Online IDE is <strong>no longer supported</strong>. GitPod has become ONA and now requires all GitHub users to grant access to all their repositories, including private ones. It seems they require this in order to feed their AI-based systems. To us, this is not okay, which is why we no longer actively support it here. Sorry for the inconvenience!
