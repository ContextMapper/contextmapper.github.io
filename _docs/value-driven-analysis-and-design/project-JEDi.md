Contributed by [Project JEDi («Just Enough Digitalization»)](tbd), Context Mapper offers tool support for multiple steps of the [Value-Driven Analysis and Design](tbd) process (such as [Stakeholder Mapping](tbd) and [Value Impact Mapping](tbd)) as well as [Story Valuation](https://github.com/ethical-se/ese-practices/blob/main/practices/ESE-StoryValuation.md) by [Ethical Software Engineering (ESE)](https://github.com/ethical-se/ese-practices). 

## Language Features

The following pages document the CML features that support modelling stakeholders of a project or system and the ethical values important to them:

 * [Stakeholder](/docs/stakeholders/)
 * [Value Registers](/docs/value-registers/)
 * [User Requirements (see "Story Valuation")](/docs/user-requirements/#story-valuation)

## Transformations

Context Mapper provides several transformations that ease the modelling of stakeholders and their values. These transformations are documented [here](/docs/stakeholder-and-value-modelling-transformations/).

## Generators

By using the language features mentioned above, you can automatically generate:

 * [Stakeholder Maps](tbd) with our [PlantUML generator](/docs/plant-uml/)
 * [Value Impact Maps](tbd) with our [PlantUML generator](/docs/plant-uml/)
 * CSV files with the stakeholder data by using our [Generic Generator (Freemarker Templating)](/docs/generic-freemarker-generator/)
 * CSV files with the value register data by using our [Generic Generator (Freemarker Templating)](/docs/generic-freemarker-generator/)

**Note**: The freemarker templates can be found [here](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl/tree/master/org.contextmapper.dsl.ui/samples/freemarker/csv-files).
