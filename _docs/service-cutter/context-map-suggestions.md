<div class="alert alert-custom">
<strong>Coming soon ... (under construction)</strong>
<br/><br/>
With the next releases we will integrate Service Cutter into the Context Mapper tool and offer the possibility to create new Context Map 
suggestions directly.
</div>

For now, you can already use our [Service Cutter input files generator](/docs/service-cutter/) and analyze your model within the [Service Cutter](http://servicecutter.github.io/)
tool.
