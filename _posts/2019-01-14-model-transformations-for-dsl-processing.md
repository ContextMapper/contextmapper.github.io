title:  "Model Transformations for DSL Processing"
author: Stefan Kapferer
---

With our next major Context Mapper release we will provide architectural refactorings (ARs) which allow the user/architect to evolve and
improve the modeled architecture iteratively. As a "proof-of-concept" we implemented a model transformation with the [Henshin](https://www.eclipse.org/henshin/)
transformation tool. The implementation of this first refactoring was part of a seminar (paper & presentation) at [HSR](https://www.hsr.ch).

Below you can find the links to the paper and the presentation.

## Abstract
Model transformation is a key concept in Model-driven Software Development (MDD) and refers to an automated process transforming 
one model into another model. Models can be seen as an abstraction of a system or any concept in the world. They can be represented in
various ways, for example graphically, as text or even code. Thus, models are a powerful instrument which is used in all disciplines 
of software engineering. This paper gives an introduction into model transformation and its classifications. It provides an overview 
over existing transformation tools and presents [Henshin](https://www.eclipse.org/henshin/) as one particular approach based on
algebraic graph transformation. It further summarizes the theory behind this graph transformation approach based on graph grammars. 
With an example application in the context of architectural refactorings and service decomposition, this paper demonstrates how model 
transformation can be applied to Domain-specific Language (DSL) processing. Finally, the [Henshin](https://www.eclipse.org/henshin/) 
concepts and its tools are evaluated based on the experience gained through the development of the presented examples.
