	    <h1>A Modeling Framework for Strategic Domain-driven Design and Service Decomposition</h1>
        <p>ContextMapper is an open source project providing a Domain-specific Language (DSL) based on Domain-driven Design (DDD) patterns for context mapping and service decomposition. The framework
        components around the language support to reverse engineer Context Maps, analyze the models with respect to coupling criteria, improve the architecture iteratively, and generate other
        representations out of the DDD Context Maps.</p>

              Context Mapper provides a DSL to create <strong>Context Maps</strong> based on strategic <strong>Domain-driven Design (DDD)</strong>. DDD with its Bounded Contexts offers an approach for
              <strong>decomposing a domain or system</strong> into multiple independently deployable (micro-)services. With our <strong><a href="/docs/architectural-refactorings/">Architectural
              Refactorings (ARs)</a></strong> we provide transformation tools to refactor and decompose a system in an iterative way. With the
              <strong><a href="/docs/service-cutter-context-map-suggestions/">Service Cutter</a></strong> integration you can generate suggestions for new Context Maps exhibiting services and Bounded Contexts with improved coupling.
              With the <strong><a href="/docs/generators">generators</a></strong> you are able to derive other representations of the architectural model, such as <strong><a href="http://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a></strong>
              diagrams or <strong><a href="https://socadk.github.io/MDSL/">MDSL</a></strong> (micro-)service contracts. The <strong><a href="/docs/reverse-engineering">reverse engineering library</a></strong>
              supports you in generating Context Maps of existing systems.

          <p>
            CML is an easy to understand, Xtext-based, <strong>DSL for DDD context mapping</strong>. The language supports modeling the relationships between Bounded Contexts with the strategic DDD patterns.
            The details of the Bounded Contexts with its Aggregates can be specified with the tactic DDD patterns. Checkout our <a href="/docs/home/">docs</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-examples" target="_blank">examples</a> for an introduction into our language.

          <h3 class="text-center">Service Decomposition</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Decompose</strong> your systems architecture by applying <strong><a href="/docs/architectural-refactorings/">Architectural Refactorings (ARs)</a></strong> iteratively. By splitting and merging
            Bounded Contexts or Aggregates, the <strong>coupling</strong> between your Bounded Contexts and the <strong>cohesion</strong> between them can be improved. The
            <strong><a href="/docs/service-cutter-context-map-suggestions/">Service Cutter</a></strong> tool can support the process by suggesting improved decompositions based on its <strong>
            <a href="https://github.com/ServiceCutter/ServiceCutter/wiki/Coupling-Criteria">coupling criteria</a></strong> catalog.

          <h3 class="text-center">Generators & Reverse Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            Use your Context Map to generate other representations of the architecture, such as <strong><a href="/docs/plant-uml/">PlantUML</a></strong> component and class diagrams. The
            <strong><a href="/docs/mdsl/">MDSL (micro-)service contracts</a></strong> generator can provide assistance regarding how your system can be implemented in an (micro-)service-oriented architecture.
            Our <strong><a href="/docs/reverse-engineering/">reverse engineering library</a></strong> can further generate CML Context Maps from existing source code.
